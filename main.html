            <h4>Jack Russels</h4>
            <p><b>Best for:</b> Hunting</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b> The Jack Russell is a sturdy, tough terrier, very much on its toes all the time. The body length must be in proportion to the height, and it should present a compact, balanced image, always being in solid, hard condition. The head should be well balanced and in proportion to the body.

            <h4>Pitbulls</h4>
            <p><b>Best for:</b> Hunting, Self defense/Saftey</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b> The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous, as it encompasses a range of pedigree breeds, informal types and appearances that cannot be reliably identified. Formal breeds often considered to be of the pit bull type include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

            <h4>English Bulldogs</h4>
            <p><b>Best for:</b> Cutness, but were originally bred for bull-baiting</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b> The Bulldog is a thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser whose 'sourmug' face is the universal symbol of courage and tenacity.
